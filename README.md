What is the theme you’ll be using for project 2?
    My theme is a chat-bot. 
● How did you incorporate your theme within your project?
    My chatbot is suppose to allow users to send messages to the robot.
● What are at least 5 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
    1. My application did not want to push to heroku. I am still solving this problem.
    2. I had trouble with getting the server to work. I restarted the process and that fixed it.
    3. I also had trouble with adding the database
    4. Trying to nitpick where I messed up and fix the small errors took long. I would have 
    to restart processes to make sure things work.
    5. At first i couldn't push to github. But I got it to work by changing the name "origin".
● What are known problems, if any, with your project?
1. every push failed for heroku 
2. my jsx did not work so for now it is left out. 

● How would you improve it if you had more time?
1. tried to get heroku to deploy before I started. I would get jsx to work and then get the server working.
